# Bonus: Diffusion in NLP

Welcome to the bonus section on Diffusion Models in NLP! This is a cutting-edge area of research that is rapidly gaining traction. In this section, we'll explore the fundamentals of diffusion models and how they are being adapted for the complex task of text generation.

## Overview of Diffusion Models

At a high level, diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to create data by reversing a gradual noising process. Imagine taking a clear sentence, adding noise to it step-by-step until it's completely garbled, and then training a model to reverse that process. That's the core idea behind diffusion!

## How are they adapted for text generation?

Applying diffusion models to text is not as straightforward as with images. Text is discrete (made up of individual tokens), while the original diffusion models were designed for continuous data (like pixel values). Researchers have developed clever ways to bridge this gap, often by working with the continuous vector representations (embeddings) of words.
