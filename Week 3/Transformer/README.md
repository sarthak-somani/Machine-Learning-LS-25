# Transformers
Transformers are a type of deep learning model introduced in the 2017 paper ["Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf) . They revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and are now used in many domains like vision, speech, and more.

Applications:
- NLP: BERT, GPT, T5, etc.

- Vision: Vision Transformers (ViT)

- Speech, Recommendation Systems, Genomics, etc.

## Recurrent Neural network (RNN):
In order to understand the Transformer Architecture, It is Important to understand the RNN Stucture

## LSTM RNN
Traditional RNNs struggle with vanishing gradients, making them bad at remembering information over long sequences.
LSTM solves this using a memory cell and gates that control information flow.

## Encoder-Decoder
The Encoder-Decoder is a neural network architecture designed to handle sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) tasks â€” where input and output are both sequences, possibly of different lengths.

## Attention Mechanism
The attention mechanism allows a model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output.

It was introduced to improve performance in sequence-to-sequence tasks (like translation), especially in long sequences.

## Transformers
### Key Concepts:
- [Self-Attention](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2023/self-attention-from-scratch.html) :
  Allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding a specific word.

- [Positional Encoding](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-positional-encoding-in-transformer-models-part-1/) :
Since transformers don't process sequences in order (like RNNs), positional encodings are added to retain word order.
