# Week 4 - Wrap Up Project - Next Word Predictor using Transformers

Welcome to the final project of our four-week NLP journey! Over the past few weeks, you’ve explored the core building blocks of natural language processing — from tokenization and word embeddings to sequence models and transformers. Now, it’s time to bring it all together. In this wrap-up project, you'll build a next-word predictor using a transformer-based model like GPT-2. This kind of model powers real-world tools like autocomplete, chatbots, and writing assistants. You’ll get hands-on experience working with Hugging Face’s popular `transformers` library, fine-tuning a pretrained model, and evaluating how well it performs at predicting what comes next in a sentence.

##  Problem Statement

Design and train a transformer-based language model to predict the next word in a given text sequence. This task is foundational in NLP and supports applications such as autocomplete, text generation, and intelligent writing assistants.

##  Objectives

- Build a language model for next-word prediction using transformer architecture.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-2) on a textual dataset.
- Evaluate the model using standard metrics like perplexity and top-k accuracy.
- Understand and apply best practices for tokenizer alignment, model adaptation, and text preprocessing.

##  Datasets

- **General Text Corpora:**
    - **WikiText-2:** Clean Wikipedia articles suitable for structured language learning.
    - **OpenWebText:** Large-scale web data similar to GPT-2’s pretraining corpus.
- **Domain-Specific Data (Optional):**
    - Custom datasets such as academic papers, technical documentation, or support dialogues can be used for specialized modeling.

##  Training Steps

1. **Data Loading & Tokenization**: Load your dataset with `datasets` and tokenize it using `AutoTokenizer`.
2. **Model Selection**: Use a pretrained model `GPT2LMHeadModel` for next-word prediction.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Train the model using the `Trainer` API or a custom PyTorch loop.
4. **Evaluation**: Measure performance with the metrics perplexity and top-k accuracy.

## Optional Extensions
- Explore larger transformer variants for improved accuracy (e.g., gpt2-medium, gpt2-large).
- Deploy the model with a basic interface using Streamlit or Gradio for interactive demonstrations.
- Compare transformer-based performance with a baseline LSTM model.
