# Introduction to Text Classification Using Logistic Regression

Text classification is a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves assigning predefined categories to text data. Logistic Regression is a widely used, interpretable, and effective machine learning algorithm for binary and multiclass text classification tasks.

In this guide, we explore key learning materials and structured tutorials to help you get started with building your own logistic regression-based text classifier.

Below are carefully selected resources to support your learning:

## Understanding the Fundamentals of Logistic Regression

Before applying logistic regression to text classification tasks, it is beneficial to develop a solid understanding of how the algorithm works, particularly the mathematical foundations.
