# Introduction to Text Classification Using Logistic Regression

Text classification is a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves assigning predefined categories to text data. Logistic Regression is a widely used, interpretable, and effective machine learning algorithm for binary and multiclass text classification tasks.

In this guide, we explore key learning materials and structured tutorials to help you get started with building your own logistic regression-based text classifier.

Below are carefully selected resources to support your learning:

## Understanding the Fundamentals of Logistic Regression

Before applying logistic regression to text classification tasks, it is beneficial to develop a solid understanding of how the algorithm works, particularly the mathematical foundations.

## Applying Logistic Regression to Text Classification

Once the foundational concepts are clear, the next step is to explore practical applications of logistic regression for text classification tasks. We will do this through reviewing existing implementations.

### Implementation Using Existing Libraries

- [Dr. Lee’s Blog: Text Preprocessing and Classification](https://drlee.io/text-preprocessing-and-classification-with-logistic-regression-ea4fe3cfcaac) <br>
  This article, along with the accompanying Jupyter Notebook, presents an implementation of logistic regression for text classification. Reviewing the implementation will provide you with practical insight into how logistic regression can be applied effectively for NLP tasks.

- [GeeksforGeeks: Text Classification Using Logistic Regression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/text-classification-using-logistic-regression/) <br>
  This tutorial complements the previous resource by offering another end-to-end example of text classification using logistic regression. It walks through text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, model training, and evaluation, reinforcing the core steps involved in building a simple yet effective classifier.

### Implementation from Scratch (Without High-Level Libraries)

- [GitHub Repo: Manual Implementation](https://github.com/YukihoKirihara/Text-Classification-by-a-Logistic-Regression-Model-from-Scratch.git) <br>
  This repository is an example of how to implement logistic regression for text classification without relying on high-level machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. Understanding the implementation is not necessary but useful for gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the algorithm.
